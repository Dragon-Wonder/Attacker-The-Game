# Attacker: The Game
A game I am working on as a way to teach myself c++ putting it here mainly to have a version in a central location, but also to get feedback and help if I get any.

This game is super simple, and as I said I am mostly just using it as a way to improve my understanding of c++. I will welcome any tips or ideas for improvements that someone might provide.

The game itself is boiled down to the most basic level of a game. There are five stats that you can set up however you wish (but there must be at least 1 skill point in each stat).

Strength (STR) - How much damage you do.

Constitution (CONS) - Your health.

Dexterity (DEX) - Effects your chance to dodge. (Will do more later).

Defence (DEF) - Effects how much damage you take.

Luck (LUK) - The random chance things will go your way with dodges, crits, and monsters that spawn.



You must go through 10 randomly generated dungeons fighting monsters along the way.

During each battle you may 'Attack' in which case you and the monster both trade blows. You can 'Heal' for 10% of you maxmium health and the monster does less damage or exit the game.

On each level you are trying to get the the down stairs which is represented by "<". While the player is a "+". Doors are "$" currently they don't do anything special, but that will likely change in a furture verison.

Like I said there is not a lot to the game as of right now but that is partly why I'm putting the game here so I can get feedback and ideas on how to improve the game.

##Goals

I have a few goals in mind about what I want to do with this but I am always looking for more ideas. Post any you have in issues as a suggestion.
