# Attcker-The Game
A game I am working on as a way to teach myself c++ putting it here mainly to have a version in a central location, but also to get feedback and help if I get any.

This game is super simple, and as I said I am mostly just using it as a way to improve my understnad of c++. I will more than any tips or ideas for improvements that someone might provide.

The game itself is boiled down to the most basic level of a game. There are five stats that you can set up however you wish (but there must be aleast 1 skill point in each stat).

Strength (STR) - How much damage you do.

Constitution (CONS) - Your health.

Dexterity (DEX) - Effects if you move first and if you dodge.

Defence (DEF) - Effects how much damage you take.

Luck (LUK) - The Random chance things will go your way with dodges and crits.



There are 10 "levels" where you fight a zombie of increasing strength and if you kill it you advance to the next level.

During each battle you may Attack in which case you and the monster both trade blows. You can heal for 10% of you maxium health and the monster does less damage or exit the game.

Like I said there is not a lot to the game as of right now but that is partly why I'm putting the game here so I can get feedback and ideas on how to improve the game.

##Goals

I have a few goals in mind about what I want to do with this but I am always looking for more ideas.

###Short-Term

*Implent More Monster that have different stats and increase the variaty a bit

*More actions during a battle (no ideas on what)

*Redo the Monster Leveling up system (a bit wonky right now)

  ~Might need to also redo entirely the damage and health calculation depending on what I end up changing


###Long-term

*Add Pictures 

  ~This is a real long term goal and will take a bit of work
  
  ~Monsters, move onto health bars then finally do the player.

*A Looting system(?) 

  ~Unsure of this one but I think it would be a cool idea
  
*MORE LEVELS

  ~Of course if I am going to add all this stuff I will need to extend the game to make it worth while
  
*Save System

  ~If I make the game longer I will likely want to look into this.
