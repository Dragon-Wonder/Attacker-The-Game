### Updated
* Rewrote the program from the ground up
* Program now uses SDL graphics

* Versioning to be more inline with my other programs

### Notes
* Reset the verisoning, depracated all earlier versions
* I wanted to make a new game from stratch but kept coming back to this one, so I just decided to redo this one from the ground up.
* This is the first of the rewrites. At the moment it can make a dungeon and allows you to walk around. It is very skeleton like and has a lot of features tagged as "add later"
